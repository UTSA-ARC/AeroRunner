Soooooo I've done a bit on the github. Here's a list of what's been done:

    Github:
    - Created a github organization and added members (Ping me with your github user so I can add you if you want)
    - Created repositories for the Hardware, Code, and Ground support.
    - Created a reference repo for Spaceport 2023 (References other repos so sharing everything is easier \:D)

    Linda Code:
    - Migrated over repo from personal to organization repo
    - Converted everything to follow semantic versioning**
    - Cleaned up main branch with functions in functions.h, having main be only client code **Ideally**
    - Documented all the functions
    - Setup Workflow pipelines for tests**
    - Setup branch protections to enforce Pull Requests before merging to release or feature branches**
    - Setup branch protection to enforce code reviews on release branches**
    - Created release/V1.0.0 branch
    - Created feature/setup-e-match branch

    Linda Hardware:
    - Organized into folders

    Ground support: ~

    **Will explain further at meeting

I'll go over git, github, and versioning, if anyone wants to help with the development proccess, next meeting.
One other thing is that because I'm using PlatformIO, there is a builtin testing tool. I gotta learn how to write unit tests but it should help a lot in the future.
